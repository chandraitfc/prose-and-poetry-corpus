Today Lily woke up with a big smile on her face because it was the first of November and her birthday was now just two weeks away. Her grandparents had come for a short visit and like every time, they gifted a plant to her. Lily asked, “Why do you give me a plant every time you visit? ” Grandpa said, “Because when this plant will grow, it will give us more oxygen and clean and fresh air. ” Lily kept the new plant beside a bunch of other plants in the balcony. Later in the afternoon over lunch, while looking at the plants, Lily said, “Idea! Ma, Papa, shall we give plants as a return gift to my friends on my birthday? ” Lily’s parents were surprised but they liked the idea and asked how she had thought of it. Lily said, “Just like Grandma and Grandpa give me a plant every time, I thought I also could give a plant to each of my friends. ” Lily’s parents smiled and said, “Tomorrow we will go to the nursery and get those plants. ”The next day Lily and her grandpa went to the nursery and saw lots of different plants. Lily selected colourful ones and said to Grandpa, “I am really excited to give these gifts to my friends and can’t wait to see how they feel. ”She also made a handwritten note to give with each plant. It read, “Take care of them and water them regularly. "Days passed by and soon it was Lily’s birthday. All her friends came to her house in colourful dresses with gifts. Lily cut the cake. Everybody sang the birthday song and wished her but Lily was waiting for the moment to give the return gifts that she had selected. Finally, the moment arrived and she said, “Here are your return gifts! ” All her friends were surprised to see the colourful plants. Lily also told her friends, “If we all look after them properly, they will help protect our environment by giving plenty of oxygen and clean air. ” All her friends loved their gifts and promised to take care of them.
