It was a rainy evening and Tom was walking home in a raincoat, when he suddenly spotted a nice alarm clock on the side of the road. Tom thought “Someone must have lost it”. He looked around and thought he could take it, but little did he know someone was watching him. He did not think much of it and went to sleep. He woke up to the alarm clock ringing, but that surprised him because he remembered that there were no batteries in the clock. He did not think much of it and he went to school. When he was coming back, he noticed a beautiful pencil box with a lot of pens and pencils inside of it. He decided to take that as well. When he woke up he found the box on the floor, with its contents everywhere. He distinctly remembered putting them on the table but he thought nothing of it and he went to school. He was awoken in the middle of the night to a jarring sight. He saw the alarm clock and all the pens levitating in the air. “WHAT IS GOING ON? !” He shouted, scared. He saw a thin white wispy figure in the corner of his room. “Who’s there? !” he shouted but that figure vanished into thin air. Tom could not focus in school. He kept wondering what he saw. He went to the computer lab and did some research and he found out it was a ghost! This time he stayed up all night and he saw the ghost. The ghost told him to come to the graveyard. Tom went to the graveyard and saw the ghost there waiting for him. “I was alone when I died and no one came to visit me, so I left those items for you. I did not lose them. I was your uncle. ” The ghost explained. Now I can finally pass on to the other world now that I met you. And he disappeared with a flash of bright light. Tom collapsed onto his bed at night and sighed with relief “I can finally have a good night’s sleep” He said. Or will he? .. .
