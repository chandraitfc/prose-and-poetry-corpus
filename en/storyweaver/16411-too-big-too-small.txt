“I can’t lift you up, Shanu! ” says Ammi. “You are too big! ”“You can’t walk 
to school alone, Shanu! ” says Abbu. “You are too small! ”“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu! ” says Dadu. “You are too big! ”“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu! ” says Dadi. “You are too small! ”Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big and too small all at once? Too big to wear her old pink frock. Too small to make dosas at the stove. Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back? Too smallto carry the baby on hers? “What am I the right size for? ” Shanu wonders. Ammi smiles and says, “Why, you are just big enough to go to big school. ”“And you are just small enough for me to carry you on my shoulders, ” says Abbu. “You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks, ” says Dadu. “And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to, ” says Dadi. “And you will always, always be the perfect size. .. for this! " all say, and give 
her a warm, wonderful hug.
