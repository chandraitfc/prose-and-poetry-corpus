Bora is sitting at the clinic with Baba. Jojo, his stuffed monkey, came too. Jojo is sleeping in Bora’s bag. “I don’t like needles. They hurt! ” says Bora. “An injection helps make you healthy. It’s okay to be scared, Bora. Baba will be right here with you. And Jojo too. ”“Bora Baraka! ” a loud voice calls. “Let’s go Bora, ” says Baba. “It’s your turn. ”“Let’s come back tomorrow Baba! ” says Bora. “Remember what Baba said you will get for being brave enough to get your injection? ” asks Baba. “A red lollipop! Okay, I’m coming, ” says Bora. The doctor smiles at Bora. “Is this your monkey? Can we examine him too? ” she asks. Bora looks at Baba, then at Jojo, and nods. “Now, it’s your turn, ” she says. Will you help me give your monkey a small injection so he feels better? ” asks the doctor. “TOOP! ” says the doctor as she gives Jojo the monkey an injection. “Now, it’s your turn. Is that a superhero on your T-shirt? ” she asks. “TOOP! ”She says as she gives Bora the injection. “Ouch! ” shouts Bora. “Hey, that wasn’t so bad! ”“I know it stings a little, but we’re done and you have been very brave! ” says the doctor. "One red lollipop for our brave Bora! "
