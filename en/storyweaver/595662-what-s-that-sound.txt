Every night, strange noises filled Fria’s room as she slept on her bed. She’d gaze the night sky twinkling outside her bedroom window and the moon nestled between the tall trees. She lived close to the forest. So as night fell upon her little cottage, She would hear sounds, chirps, bellows from the forest. One night, a loud cry woke her up with a jolt. “What’s that sound? ”asked Fria. She bent down from her window and listened closely at the mysterious forest. Nothing is heard for a few seconds and then, A HOWL. somewhere between the trees. Fria put on her coat and left her house. She made her way to the forest in the cold air. First, she encountered a parliament of Owls. They were singing: 'HOO-HOO'She asked the Owl, "What is that sound? "The owl replied: I Hoot in the night, And I sleep during the day light! She bid them good-bye and moved on. Then she came across the crickets in trees. They went: 'CHIRP-CHIRP'. She bent down and asked, “What’s that sound? ”The Cricket replied: In the night, I chirp, To some it sounds like a burp! Next, she heard the 'BUZZING' from the fireflies that twinkled in the night sky. Fria, awe-struck, chased after them and called out, “What’s that sound? ”The fireflies chorused: We Buzz, in the night, as our lights ignite! Fria walked further on, in the forest, as different sounds pricked her ears. As the night unfolded, Fria encountered more creatures and their unique sounds. She returned to her house with a broad smile, for now she knew the secrets behind the night-time serenade. And she finally understood the sounds and who they belonged. She, too, went to sleep and contributed to the symphonies with her rhythmic snores!
