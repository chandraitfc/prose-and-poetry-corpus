“Ice cream! Ice cream! ” The shopkeeper called. Reba ran to her mother. “Ma! Ma! I want ice cream! ” “Finish your homework first, ” said Ma. Reba looked unhappy. Ma asked, “Are you done with your homework yet? ”“Mmm. .. No. But my notebook is full! I need to buy another one. ”Ma gave Reba 50 taka. “Go buy a notebook. We also need a bar of soap. " Taka is the name of currency used in Bangladesh. Reba went to the shop. The shopkeeper gave Reba a notebook and a bar of soap. “How much? ” asked Reba. “The notebook is 20 taka, and the soap is 20 taka, ” said the shopkeeper. “That means the total cost is 40 taka. Here’s your change. ”When Reba came back home, she calculated her change. Reba gave the shopkeeper 50 taka. The notebook was 20 taka, and the soap was 20 taka. “I should only get 10 taka back, ” thought Reba. “Why did the shopkeeper give me 20 taka back? ”“That's great! ” thought Reba. “I can buy ice cream with this extra money! ” But Reba was ashamed of herself. “I should go back and give the shopkeeper the correct change. ”Reba rushed back to the shop. There were so many kinds of ice creams that she wanted! “Oh, if only I could have an ice-cream! ” she thought. When Reba got to the shop, she saw another girl who had just bought ice cream. She was about to go home. The shopkeeper stopped her. “Wait! ” he said. “You've given me too much money. Come back, take the change. ”The shopkeeper gave the girl her change. Reba stepped forward. “You gave me 10 extra taka. Please take your money back. ”“You’re such an honest girl! ”The shopkeeper was so happy with Reba’s honesty that he gave her an ice cream for free! Reba happily licked herice cream all the way home.
