This is me, Aman. This is my T-shirt. It is bright red. I love my red T-shirt. My red T-shirt is very old. I got it when I was small. It has become dirty many times. It has been washed again and again. Now, it has three holes in it! Or maybe more. But my T-shirt is so soft. It fits me just as I like it to fit me. This is my Ma. I love her very much. She loves me too. She gives me chocolates. She helps me with my school work. If I let her, she combs my hair. Ma hates my red T-shirt. She wants to throw it away. “I will buy you a nice new one, ” she says. I keep quiet. “I will not wash this T-shirt again, ” she says loudly. “You cannot throw my T-shirt away, ” I say even more loudly. Ma glares at me. I frown at her. We do not talk to each other. I say “NO” to the jalebis she gets for me. Janu didi eats up my share of jalebis. It is evening. My friends are playing cricket. I do not feel like playing. I just sit and watch. Many children are wearing old T-shirts. Look, some have holes in them. It is getting chilly. I will go home now. Here is Boo-boo, our street dog. Poor dog. He must be so cold. Ma is waiting for me at home. She hugs me when I walk in. “I will wear this T-shirt for three more days, ” I tell her. “Then I will give it to Boo-boo. It will keep him warm in the winter. May I, Ma? Please? ” “Yes, you may, ” Ma laughs. I love my red T-shirt. I think Boo-boo loves it too. Maybe he will share it with me sometimes?
