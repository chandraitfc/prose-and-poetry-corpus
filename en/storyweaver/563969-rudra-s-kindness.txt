One day when he went shopping with his parents, he saw an old woman trying to cross the road. He went and helped her to cross the road and she said: "thank you, dear boy, here is a bar of chocolate for you. Rudra took the chocolate from the old woman and thanked her. Instead of taking the bar of chocolate home, he gave the chocolate to a needy boy and said you need it more than I do. Rudra did many other good deeds, he also celebrates his birthday in the orphanage every year and gives gifts to orphans. One day his parents said they have to go somewhere and Rudra has to be alone.
