Once upon a time, a fairy was trying to see who was kind enough to give her some water from the well. She got a bucket, and she thought she should get her special jewel. She went looking for her jewel, and then, she found it. She had a big, red jewel to put in the bucket. It was a ruby, and it was a special, magical jewel. When you have this jewel, everything goes well for you. If you need some food, it will appear for you. If you need some water or clothes, they will appear for you. If you start turning greedy, the jewel will turn into a gray rock. There will not be anything special about it. After some days, the fairy thought it was time to test the people. She went to a deep well and put the bucket in the well with the jewel in it. She turned herself into an old lady. Then, she asked people who went by, “Can you give me some water from the well? ”But, they did not want to. They just walked by the old woman and said that she could do it herself. She asked one person after the other, but every single person would say the same thing. No one would give her water from the well. After some time, a little girl named Polly came along. The old woman said to Polly, “Can you give me some water from the well? ” The girl said, “Yes. ” She pulled and pulled until the bucket was all the way up. The bucket was full of water. Then, the old woman turned back into a fairy. She said, “Thank you for pulling the water up. You get this jewel that is in the bucket, because you were kind enough to get me the water. ” So, the girl went home happily. The fairy was glad to find a kind girl who would help others. The girl never became greedy, so the jewel never turned into a gray rock.
