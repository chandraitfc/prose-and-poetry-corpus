In the clear sky, the sun is sad and alone. He looks down and sees fish swimming happily in the water. Wanting to join them, he tells the fish, “How happy you all look! May I play with you? ”As he comes closer, the fish shout, “Don’t come closer please. It’s too hot for us! ”“I will cover myself with a cloth, ” says the sun. But, the cloth catches fire! “Boohoo! ” the sun begins to cry. A bird flying past asks, “Why are you crying? ”"I want to play with the fish. But, I am too hot and will burn them if I get too close. "“Go in the evening when it is cool. They will not get burnt then, ” says the bird. That evening, the sun comes down to the river. Splashhh! “I can finally swim with the fish! "“Now it’s not too hot for us”, say the fish happily. The sun, not sad and lonely anymore, says, "Let's play together every evening! "
