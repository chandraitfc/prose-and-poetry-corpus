Baby: "Mummy, I can't stay inside this dark room anymore. Please. Save me. Please let me out. 
Mother: "Dear one, don't worry. I'm here only. Be a little patient."
After a few days, Baby: "I can't be more patient than this. I myself will try."
Mother: "Dear one, look how beautiful you look. Eat these green leaves."
Baby: "Uvek! Not nice. I want to drink sweet honey just like you. 
Mother: "Dear one, for that, you have to grow up. Now, you eat these leaves."
Mother: "Eat some more leaves. Then only you can become strong."
Baby: "Chee! She keeps on asking me to eat, eat. Do I have to always listen to her? She drinks sweet honey from beautiful flowers. But, for me these bitter leaves. Aah."
Mother: "Dear one, have you not slept. It is time to sleep."       
Baby: "Go, mom. I will not sleep. Do I have to always do as you  tell? You are happy. But, look at me."
Mother: "Dear little one, you don't have to always listen to me. But, I will only tell things that are good for you. Keep that in mind. 
Baby: "Now, you go. I'm going to sleep. Don't advise."
Baby: "I slept for a long time. Oh! Mummy, look at this. I have also changed into a butterfly just like you."
Mother: "I'm very happy. You have become a beautiful butterfly now."
Baby: "Thanks, mom. Because of you, I became a butterfly."
Mother: "You have got strong wings because you underwent pain. Now, fly away and drink honey from the flowers."
