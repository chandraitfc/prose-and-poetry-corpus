Adil is always late to school. His class teacher, Miss Rupal, is angry. “You missed 15 minutes of maths class today, ” she scolds him. “You missed 15 minutes of art yesterday. ”Adil feels terrible. “Why am I never on time? ” he asks his best friend Paro. “Where do all the minutes go? ”Paro decides to help Adil find the lost minutes. “At what time do you wake up? ” she asks. “Ma wakes me up at 8am, ” Adil says. “If I’m feeling lazy, I lie in bed for five more minutes. ”“What do you do next? ” Paro asks. “I take 25 minutes to get ready and 15 minutes to eat breakfast. It takes 20 minutes to walk to school. "Together, that is one hour. I should reach school by 9am. ” Paro writes, 25 + 15 + 20 = 60. 60 minutes make an hour. “Do you always get ready on time? ” Paro asks. “Sometimes I have to sharpen my pencil, ” Adil says. "Sometimes my milk is too hot to drink. “Sometimes I have to find my Hindi book. But those things take seconds. ”“If you add all the seconds, you will get four or five minutes, ” Paro laughs. “Maybe three minutes, ” Adil agrees. 60 seconds make a minute. 180 seconds make three minutes. “I have seen you playing with Bittu’s puppies and buying sweets on the way to school, ” Paro says. “I play with the puppies for five minutes, ” Adil says. “And spend less than two minutes buying sweets. That makes no difference. ”“Every minute makes a difference, ” Paro says. “If you add the extra time in bed, the time to sharpen pencils and everything else, you take 75 minutes to get to school. ”5 minutes extra in bed, 3 minutes extra while getting ready, 5 minutes playing with the puppies, 2 minutes buying sweets = 15 minutes. “That is not one hour, ” Paro says. “That is one hour and 15 minutes. Do you know what that means? ”“Yes, ” Adil groans. “It means that I will have to wake up 15 minutes early — at 7. 45am. "It means Miss Rupal will be happy, and I will be sleepy and sad. ”
